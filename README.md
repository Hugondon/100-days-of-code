# 100 Days of Web Development

# Log - Round 1 - Hugo PÃ©rez

TODO: make resources.md an useful guide.

## Day 1 | August 1st, Monday | First HTML Page

**Today's Progress**: Just started the challenge. My second Hello World using HTML :)

**Thoughts:** I'm nervous about starting this project. Although I'm excited to learn about web development and everything you can do with it, my main goal is to develop my self-discipline.

## Day 2 | August 2nd, Tuesday | HTML Page + CSS Introduction

**Today's Progress**: Adding attributes to tags and researched on how to include an image to the displayed file.

**Thoughts:** I didn't even feel the hour pass by! The hardest part was sitting and doing the code. I'm to happy to be learning something that I had been postponing for a long time. I'm interested in doing some extra work for each new thing that I learn...

## Day 3 | August 3th, Wednesday | CSS in separate file + new attributes were changed + enter new fonts

**Today's Progress**: Adding a link to the existing text. Separating in a different file the informationfo reach paragraph. Add new fonts using Google Fonts.

**Thoughts:** Using Google Fonts seems to be useful for multiple purposes! I'm pretty sure that I will exploit it in the near future.

**Link to work:** [Day Three](https://github.com/Hugondon/100-days-of-code/blob/master/Code/Days_1-5/index_day_three.html)

## Day 4 | August 4th, Thursday | Styling images and general background using body tag. Adding a new file and playing with divs

**Today's Progress**: Got to know some styling that can be done to images (modifying height and width in percentages, border-radius) and to the general body; added a new page and a link to it. I wanted to follow the course my way, so I modified the progress to be oriented to displaying something about Wish You Were, one of my all time favorite songs.

**Thoughts:** When trying to show two images in parallel, I ran into the problem of not knowing how to do it with my current knowledge. I was happy to learning how to do it after some google searches :) (although I'm pretty sure that this is not the correct way).

**Link to work:** [Day Four](https://github.com/Hugondon/100-days-of-code/blob/master/Code/Days_1-5/index_day_four.html)

## Day 5 | August 5th, Friday | Organizing files + Live Server + Lists

**Today's Progress**: Today I was introduced to a way that files can be organized in a project, to the Live Server extension on Visual Studio Code and a bit of ordered / unordered lists :).

**Thoughts:** Today was specially hard to work because I was having some other things to the (play Age of Empires), but part of this challenge is learning to be constant, so here I am!

**Link to work:** [Day Five](https://github.com/Hugondon/100-days-of-code/blob/master/Code/Days_1-5/index.html)

## Day 6 | August 6th, Saturday | Box Model + Selectors + Combinators

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about inheritance, cascading and specificity; CSS Box Model parts and their manipulation and, finally, about selectors and combinators to work with specific elements or groups of them.

**Thoughts:** I felt full of energy today, so I dedicated some extra time to learning (about 30m more). I've been thinking about ideas of taking some of this knowledge into Embedded Systems world, but one step at a time...

**Link to work:** [Day Six](https://github.com/Hugondon/100-days-of-code/blob/master/Code/Days_6-8/index.html)

## Day 7 | August 7th, Sunday | Inline-Block + Box-shadow + Challenge

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned box-shadow, inline, blocks and inline-block properties. I also took the challenge of replicating the page that the instructor provided, thus making me learn how to use span and negative margins.

**Thoughts:** The challenge was quite interesting! I tried my best to complete it without seeing the solution and I'm happy that I could make it almost equal to the one proposed. I am happy that I could follow a methodology and that I could go through the whole week with consistency.

**Link to work:** [Day Seven](https://github.com/Hugondon/100-days-of-code/blob/master/Code/Days_6-8/challenge.html)

## Day 8 | August 8th, Monday | Classes + Challenge

**Today's Progress**: Replicating another page was today's job. It involved using all the knowledge I had until this moment, including some things that I knew in concept but hadn't grounded yet (yes, I'm talking about you, classes). I also had to see a part of the tutorial because I didn't know how to add the highlight of specific list items.

**Thoughts:** Again, I'm proud and happy to have almost finished today's challenge without seeing the solution. There were two specific two things that I didn't know how to do and didn't know to research about, but this was fine!

## Day 11 | August 11th, Thursday | box-sizing + object-fit + linear-gradient

**Today's Progress**: Today I kept working on the example website, combining concepts of flex-boxes, padding to fix margin collapsing and learning about linear-gradient :D. It was also nice to remember that margins are usually used to work with distances between elements and padding for the height of the container.

**Thoughts:** I loved that I could finally see how to get three images on the same level with a combination of flex-boxes, box-sizing (which includes padding and border in the element's total height / weight).

## Day 12 | August 12th, Friday | overflow + grids vs flex-boxes

**Today's Progress**: Today I mainly worked with grids and the options that a developer has to configure it and its elements. It is nice to know about the existence of this kind of tool, as it is a good alternative to flex-boxes for layout design.

**Thoughts:** Today was specially a hard to work because I was tired from work, but this is a challenge of discipline more than it is of coding and I am commited to finish it.

**Link to work:** [Day Twelve](https://github.com/Hugondon/100-days-of-code/blob/master/Code/Day9-12/index.html)
