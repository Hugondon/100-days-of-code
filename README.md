# 100 Days of Web Development

# Log - Round 1 - Hugo PÃ©rez

TODO: make resources.md an useful guide.

## Day 1 | August 1st, Monday | First HTML Page

**Today's Progress**: Just started the challenge. My second Hello World using HTML :)

**Thoughts:** I'm nervous about starting this project. Although I'm excited to learn about web development and everything you can do with it, my main goal is to develop my self-discipline.

## Day 2 | August 2nd, Tuesday | HTML Page + CSS Introduction

**Today's Progress**: Adding attributes to tags and researched on how to include an image to the displayed file.

**Thoughts:** I didn't even feel the hour pass by! The hardest part was sitting and doing the code. I'm to happy to be learning something that I had been postponing for a long time. I'm interested in doing some extra work for each new thing that I learn...
