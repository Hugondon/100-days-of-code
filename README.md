# 100 Days of Web Development

# Log - Round 1 - Hugo PÃ©rez

TODO: make resources.md an useful guide.

## Day 1 | August 1st, Monday | First HTML Page

**Today's Progress**: Just started the challenge. My second Hello World using HTML :)

**Thoughts:** I'm nervous about starting this project. Although I'm excited to learn about web development and everything you can do with it, my main goal is to develop my self-discipline.

## Day 2 | August 2nd, Tuesday | HTML Page + CSS Introduction

**Today's Progress**: Adding attributes to tags and researched on how to include an image to the displayed file.

**Thoughts:** I didn't even feel the hour pass by! The hardest part was sitting and doing the code. I'm to happy to be learning something that I had been postponing for a long time. I'm interested in doing some extra work for each new thing that I learn...

## Day 3 | August 3th, Wednesday | CSS in separate file + new attributes were changed + enter new fonts

**Today's Progress**: Adding a link to the existing text. Separating in a different file the informationfo reach paragraph. Add new fonts using Google Fonts.

**Thoughts:** Using Google Fonts seems to be useful for multiple purposes! I'm pretty sure that I will exploit it in the near future.

## Day 4 | August 4th, Thursday | Styling images and general background using body tag. Adding a new file and playing with divs

**Today's Progress**: Got to know some styling that can be done to images (modifying height and width in percentages, border-radius) and to the general body; added a new page and a link to it. I wanted to follow the course my way, so I modified the progress to be oriented to displaying something about Wish You Were, one of my all time favorite songs.

**Thoughts:** When trying to show two images in parallel, I ran into the problem of not knowing how to do it with my current knowledge. I was happy to learning how to do it after some google searches :) (although I'm pretty sure that this is not the correct way).
