# 100 Days of Web Development

# Log - Round 1 - Hugo PÃ©rez

TODO: make resources.md an useful guide.

## Day 1 | August 1st, Monday | First HTML Page

**Today's Progress**: Just started the challenge. My second Hello World using HTML :)

**Thoughts:** I'm nervous about starting this project. Although I'm excited to learn about web development and everything you can do with it, my main goal is to develop my self-discipline.

## Day 2 | August 2nd, Tuesday | HTML Page + CSS Introduction

**Today's Progress**: Adding attributes to tags and researched on how to include an image to the displayed file.

**Thoughts:** I didn't even feel the hour pass by! The hardest part was sitting and doing the code. I'm to happy to be learning something that I had been postponing for a long time. I'm interested in doing some extra work for each new thing that I learn...

## Day 3 | August 3th, Wednesday | CSS in separate file + new attributes were changed + enter new fonts

**Today's Progress**: Adding a link to the existing text. Separating in a different file the informationfo reach paragraph. Add new fonts using Google Fonts.

**Thoughts:** Using Google Fonts seems to be useful for multiple purposes! I'm pretty sure that I will exploit it in the near future.

## Day 4 | August 4th, Thursday | Styling images and general background using body tag. Adding a new file and playing with divs

**Today's Progress**: Got to know some styling that can be done to images (modifying height and width in percentages, border-radius) and to the general body; added a new page and a link to it. I wanted to follow the course my way, so I modified the progress to be oriented to displaying something about Wish You Were, one of my all time favorite songs.

**Thoughts:** When trying to show two images in parallel, I ran into the problem of not knowing how to do it with my current knowledge. I was happy to learning how to do it after some google searches :) (although I'm pretty sure that this is not the correct way).

## Day 5 | August 5th, Friday | Organizing files + Live Server + Lists

**Today's Progress**: Today I was introduced to a way that files can be organized in a project, to the Live Server extension on Visual Studio Code and a bit of ordered / unordered lists :).

**Thoughts:** Today was specially hard to work because I was having some other things to the (play Age of Empires), but part of this challenge is learning to be constant, so here I am!

## Day 6 | August 6th, Saturday | Box Model + Selectors + Combinators

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about inheritance, cascading and specificity; CSS Box Model parts and their manipulation and, finally, about selectors and combinators to work with specific elements or groups of them.

**Thoughts:** I felt full of energy today, so I dedicated some extra time to learning (about 30m more). I've been thinking about ideas of taking some of this knowledge into Embedded Systems world, but one step at a time...

**Link to work:** [Day Six](https://github.com/Hugondon/100-days-of-code/blob/master/Code/Days_6-8/index.html)

## Day 7 | August 7th, Sunday | Inline-Block + Box-shadow + Challenge

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned box-shadow, inline, blocks and inline-block properties. I also took the challenge of replicating the page that the instructor provided, thus making me learn how to use span and negative margins.

**Thoughts:** The challenge was quite interesting! I tried my best to complete it without seeing the solution and I'm happy that I could make it almost equal to the one proposed. I am happy that I could follow a methodology and that I could go through the whole week with consistency.

## Day 8 | August 8th, Monday | Classes + Challenge

**Today's Progress**: Replicating another page was today's job. It involved using all the knowledge I had until this moment, including some things that I knew in concept but hadn't grounded yet (yes, I'm talking about you, classes). I also had to see a part of the tutorial because I didn't know how to add the highlight of specific list items.

**Thoughts:** Again, I'm proud and happy to have almost finished today's challenge without seeing the solution. There were two specific two things that I didn't know how to do and didn't know to research about, but this was fine!

## Day 9 | August 9th, Tuesday | Deploy + Icon + Flex-box + Background image

**Today's Progress**: Today was a productive day. I learned about deployment of websites on Netlify, how to create and use your own icon for a website and how to use flex-boxes and background images as part of a new project on the course that I'm following.

**Thoughts:** It is increible to see that just in nine days of work I've learned so much about HTML & CSS! I'm excited to see the result of the current project.

**Link to work:** [Day Nine](https://github.com/Hugondon/100-days-of-code/blob/master/Code/Day9-12/index.html)

## Day 10 | August 10th, Wednesday | Positioning

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about positioning. I learned how absolute / relative positioning can be used to manipulate the position of an image with respect to another in a page.

**Thoughts:** I like how everything I use in the course really gets together when working when trying to work to achieve some A E S T H E T I C objective.

## Day 11 | August 11th, Thursday | box-sizing + object-fit + linear-gradient

**Today's Progress**: Today I kept working on the example website, combining concepts of flex-boxes, padding to fix margin collapsing and learning about linear-gradient :D. It was also nice to remember that margins are usually used to work with distances between elements and padding for the height of the container.

**Thoughts:** I loved that I could finally see how to get three images on the same level with a combination of flex-boxes, box-sizing (which includes padding and border in the element's total height / weight).

## Day 12 | August 12th, Friday | overflow + grids vs flex-boxes

**Today's Progress**: Today I mainly worked with grids and the options that a developer has to configure it and its elements. It is nice to know about the existence of this kind of tool, as it is a good alternative to flex-boxes for layout design.

**Thoughts:** Today was specially a hard to work because I was tired from work, but this is a challenge of discipline more than it is of coding and I am commited to finish it.

**Link to work:** [Day Twelve](https://github.com/Hugondon/100-days-of-code/blob/master/Code/Day9-12/index.html)

## Day 13 | August 13th, Saturday | HTML/CSS review + responsive design

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked reviewing some of the concepts previously acquired related to HTML / CSS, before starting with responsive design of a website.

**Thoughts:** There are sooo many things to learn about Web Design, I don't know why I thought that with getting some knowledge of HTML / CSS it was enough :')

**Link to work:** [Day Thirteen](https://github.com/Hugondon/100-days-of-code/blob/master/Code/Day13-15/index.html)

## Day 14 | August 14th, Sunday | Units and Media Queries

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned more about units used to style elements (more specifically about em and rem) and also about the concept of Media Queries and its usefulness when dealing with visualization of a site using different devices.

**Thoughts:** There are sooo many things to learn about Web Design, I don't know why I thought that with getting some knowledge of HTML / CSS it was enough :')

## Day 15 | August 15th, Monday | Side Drawer + Target Selector

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about target selectors and how they can be used in combination with the aside tag to create the effect of having a side drawer in a website.

**Thoughts:** Not gonna lie, this module was really tedious for me. I'm really looking forward to start adding JavaScript to my websites, but this is a process that I have to respect, so its OK...

## Day 16 | August 16th, Tuesday | Size + Spacing + Font-size + Color

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about some tips of how to use spacing, different fonts with different sizes and combinations of grey + having a primary and an accent color to create an A E S T H E T I C site.

**Thoughts:** This lecture was totally necessary, as this is the thing that worries me the most when looking to the future is the aethetical aspect of websites.

## Day 17 | August 17th, Wednesday | Selectors + Transformations / Transitions + SVG

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about transformations / transitions of elements in HTML context by scaling and changing the background color of some elements of an example website provided by the instructor. I also learned about SVG and how they can be added. Both tools can really make the difference in the visual presentation of a website!

**Thoughts:** Both tools can really make the difference in the visual presentation of a website!

## Day 18 | August 18th, Thursday | Forms + Input types

**Today's Progress**: Today I learned about elements that are necessary to create forms in websites. I learned about the manipulation of different input types (text, email, number, password, date and radio buttons) and buttons in both HTML and CSS.

**Thoughts:** it was necessary to learn about these new types! I was beginning to wonder when would the course address this topic.

## Day 26 | August 26th, Saturday | Ifs / Fors Exercises

**Today's Progress**: Today I worked in a variety of exercises related to conditionals / loops in general. It was nice to practise the selection of different HTML elements on Javascript and working with more of them using specific control structures (once again, for in / for of). This was also a nice opportunity to use Math module functions!

**Thoughts:**
